# Khándroma Band Website
This is the official website of the band *Khándroma* from Freiburg, Germany. It is the go-to resource to get information about the band, to stay informed about the band's recent activities like new releases or upcoming shows, and to listen to the band's music or watch videos of live performances. The website provides easy access to the band's social media profiles and options for getting in touch with the band.

The essential target groups of the website are potential new listeners, returning listeners/fans, booking agents, and other interested groups such as music journalists.

The main goals of the website are:
- to provide a central platform for fans, listeners and other interested groups, to access information about the band, their music and their current activities.
- to present up-to-date information about the bands activities, such as the latest releases and upcoming shows.
- to present the band's portfolio of music and live performance videos.
- to provide a visually appealing and professional looking online presence for the band, representing their artistic and musical style.
- to bring together the band's online content and social media profiles in one central place. 
- to provide means of getting in touch with the band for fans, listeners, and booking agents or journalists alike.

![Site footer screenshot](media/screenshots/screenshot-footer.jpg)

#### Back-to-top button
Fixed at the bottom right of the viewport there is a clearly visible button, accessible from everywhere on the page, which brings the user back to the top of the page. This button only appears after scrolling down to the main content.

#### Resposive Layout
The website is fully responsive and features a flexible layout with a single column on small screens and two columns on larger screens.

### Features to be implemented in the future
#### Required features for an official release of the website
- Automatically close main navigation when a navigation item is clicked. This is not possible with plain HTML/CSS and requires some JavaScript. Then it also makes sense to make the navigation menu sticky, so that it can be accessed from anywhere on the page.
- Replace CI formdump form actions with an actual form handling method.   
- Replace stock images in image sections with pictures of the actual musicians.
- Add links to privacy policy page and imprint page in footer.
- Deploy finished website to https://khandroma.de

#### "Nice to have" features
- A photo gallery

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The website uses two main colours:
- Pink (`#cf268a`) for accents like buttons and hover effects
- Purple (`#391635`) as the main background colour. This colour is used together with black (#111111) as colour gradients for the main section backgrounds, in order to give the site a more dynamic look.

### Typography
- The font "Satellite" designed by Matt Yow, is used as the main font of the website. It is a sans serif typeface with a modern, yet elegant look. It is used for the site title, headings (regular for level 1 and 2 headings, uppercase for level 3 headings) and paragraphs. [(Go to Credits section for font source)](#fonts)
- As a secondary typeface the font "Prosto", provided by *Google Fonts*, is used for the album title of the latest album release.
- These two fonts are also used on the cover of the fourth *Khándroma* studio album *Chrystal Math*.
- The icon library *Font Awesome* is used for additional icons.

### Images
- The hero image on the website features the album artwork from the band's latest studio album, which not only makes the header visually appealing, but also adds thematic relevance to the header by reflecting the band's current activities.
- A portrait photo of the band is presented in the "About" section.
- Large photos showing the instruments featured in the band's current line-up are used as decorative dividers between the main content sections to set the mood for the site and create a music related atmosphere.

### Libraries and Software 
#### [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Font Awesome was used throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes. The necessary files have been included in the assets/fontawesome folder to avoid loading them from an external resource each time.

#### [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Google fonts was used to import the 'Prosto' font into the stylesheet. The font file has been included in the assets/fonts folder, to ensure that it does not have to be loaded from an external resource. 

#### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Git was used for version control by commiting changes to Git and push them to GitHub from the command line.

#### [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git and to deploy the website to GitHub pages at: https://nacht-falter.github.io/khandroma

#### [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)
- Pixelmator Pro was used to resize and edit images and photos for the website. 

#### [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

## Testing

### W3C Validators
The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services were used to validate the website and to ensure there were no syntax errors in the code.

The CSS validator initally only reported one issue with a CSS gradient declaration in the main stylesheet, which has been now fixed. Another issue came from the fontawesome.css stylesheet downloaded from https://fontawesome.com. That issue has been fixed by commenting out the lines of code in question. All remaining warnings refer to the stylesheets provided by FontAwesome.

The markup validator initially reported several issues with the site, most of which where either related to aria-label misuse or resulted from the embed code copied from YouTube and SoundCloud. All issues have now been fixed.

Here are the final results of the validators:

- [W3C Markup Validator results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fnacht-falter.github.io%2Fkhandroma%2Findex.html) 
- [W3C CSS Validator results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnacht-falter.github.io%2Fkhandroma%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Chrome Lighthouse
A report on the website generated with [Chrome Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) initially showed a low performance value because the image files used on the website were to big. The images have since been replaced with more compressed versions (ensuring file sizes around 200kB), which has drastically improved the performance rating.

[Chrome Lighthouse results](media/testing/khandroma-lighthouse-results.pdf)

### Further Testing
- The website was tested on a variety of devices (Desktop, Laptop, iPad, and iPhone). The following browsers and operating systems have been tested: 

	- macOS
		- Firefox
		- Google Chrome
		- Safari
	- Microsoft Windows
		- Firefox
		- Google Chrome
		- Microsoft Edge 
	- Linux
		- Firefox
		- Google Chrome
	- iOS
		- Safari
		- Firefox
  
	The website worked as expected in all tested browsers, except for the browsers on Microsoft Windows, where the declaration `width: 100vh` on the hero image section caused a scrollbar to appear at the bottom of the page. This was fixed by setting the `width`  of the hero image to `100%`.
- All links, buttons and forms where tested to make sure they work as expected.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

### Test user feedback:
- Multiple test users reported, they were confused, when the main navigation did not disappear automatically, after a menu item was clicked. This functionality could be implemented in the future using JavaScript (see [Future features](#features-to-be-implemented-in-the-future)). To avoid this problem, the navigation, for now, stays at the top of the page. Users can navigate back to the top of the page using the go-up button at the bottom right of the page.

### Known Bugs/Missing features
- The main navigation does not close automatically, when a menu item is clicked, which is not good UX. As a workaround the main navigation sticks to the top of the page for now so that it does not cover the page contents after clicking on a menu item. In the future this should be fixed by using some JavaScript to make the navigation disappear when clicking on a menu item.
- The hover effect on the hamburger button does not work properly on mobile devices, because hovering doesn't work with touchscreens. This feature is therefore disabled for smaller screens.
- The animations on the divider images between the main content sections sometimes look a bit jittery. So far, no solution for this has been found. One possibility would be to remove the animations completely, but this would make the website appear much less dynamic and atmospheric.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience Section
All user stories from the UX section have been tested. The results of these tests can be found here: [Testing User Stories](media/testing/user-stories-test.md)
