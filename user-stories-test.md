# Testing User stories from UX section
## All Visitors
### First Time Visitor Goals
-  As a first time visitor, I want to intuitively understand the purpose of the website. 
	- On opening the website, the site title and subtitle are clearly visible. While the main title "Khándroma" does not say anything about the purpose of the website, the subtitle "New album Chrystal Math out now" clearly shows, that this is a website about a band or another music related artist. To emphasize this further a CD icon has been included in the subtitle.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website using a clear and intuitive navigation.
	- The Main navigation can be opened by clicking the hamburger menu icon on the top right of the page. This icon has become widely used as a an icon representing a navigation menu ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button)), so that it should be immediately obvious how to reach the navigation. The navigation menu has only five items linking to the main sections of the website, so that the structure of the navigation should be obvious. (Refer to [Known bugs/Missing Features](#Known%20Bugs/Missing%20features) for more details on the decision to make the navigation stick to the top of the page for now).
	- Since the header/hero image takes up the whole viewport when first landing on the page, there is a animated arrow pointing downwards to indicate to new users where to find the main content and to give them an incentive to scroll down.
- As a first time visitor, I want the website to be optimized for mobile devices as well as larger screens, so that I can access the website from different devices.
	- The website has a responsive design with a [CSS Flexbox layout](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp) and media queries for five different screen sizes to maintain it's functionality and appearance on all devices and screens.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find information about the band in a concise and easily accessible way, so that I can learn about the band, their musical style, the line-up and about the musicians, who make up the band.
	- The first section following the header is the "About" section containing all the information first time visitors might be intersted in, as well as a portrait of a band.

### Returning Visitor Goals
- As a returning user I want to access recently updated information, such as upcoming show dates and recent releases.
	- The "News" section provides information on upcoming shows and events and is featured as the second section on the page for quick and easy access.  
- As a returning visitor I want to be able to sign up to the band's e-mail newsletter in order to stay informed about upcoming events or releases.
	- A mailing list subscription form is provided in the "Get in touch" section of the page. A link to that form can also be found in the "News" section.
- As a returning visitor I want to be able to contact the band through a contact form or by email, in order to get answers to any questions I might have or to give feedback.
	- A contact form is provided in the "Get in touch" section.
